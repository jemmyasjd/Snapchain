# Smart Hackathon ðŸŒŸ

## INSPIRATION ðŸ’¡

**Empowering Privacy: Securing Conversations with Blockchain:**

"Picture a world where your conversations are your own, where you can communicate freely without concerns of privacy breaches or unauthorized use of your data. In this era of digital connectivity, safeguarding our conversations is paramount. Join us as we delve into the realm of blockchain technology, empowering users to secure their communications and ensure their privacy remains intact."

## What it Does !! ðŸ‘·

Users can leverage blockchain technology to address security and privacy concerns surrounding their conversations. By utilizing the blockchain, they can rest assured that their messages are encrypted and immutable, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or tampering.

## ðŸ”§ How We Build  

We developed the frontend using React, while for the backend, we created a smart contract using Solidity for deploying on the blockchain. To interact with the smart contract, we utilized Hardhat and integrated it with the frontend using Ether.js. Additionally, we employed MongoDB to store metadata securely.

## Challenges We Ran Into ðŸ’€

Deploying smart contract posed challenges, particularly with interacting with the smart contract using Ether.js due to version differences.

## ðŸš€ How we have used Vercel in our project? ðŸš€

We deployed our application using Vercel, making it accessible to users. Try : https://snapchain-front.vercel.app/

## Future Scope ðŸ”­

Future iterations of our application could include features such as customizable encryption options for users, further enhancing their control over their conversations' security. Additionally, integration with emerging technologies like quantum encryption could offer even more robust privacy protection.
